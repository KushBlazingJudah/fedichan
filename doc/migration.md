# Migrating from FChannel

Fedichan is meant to continue development but had to make some changes along the
way to improve quality of life.
As such, it is mostly easy to migrate over however it is not without
intervention.

This list is short now but will likely grow as time goes on.
Care will be taken to make this as automatic as possible.

1. Move `config/config-init` to `fchan.cfg`.
2. You're done, hopefully
